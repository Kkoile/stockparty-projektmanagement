#Project Vision#

This project should provide a tool to run a so called "Stock Party".    
On a "Stock Party" all the prices are calculated by demand and supply. To offer an easy and fast way to pay drinks we will realize a RFID cash system. It will be possible to charge these cards and to pay with them on the bar.     
This webapp will implement the whole cash system and also a stock monitor as well as an admin panel. Furthermore there will be a alcohol sensor where the party guest can measure there alcohol level. To provide an interface for the RFID reader there will be a JS Driver developed which communicates with our node.js web client.      
There might be a feature to communicate with other stock partys which happen at the same time and to concurrent with them.
